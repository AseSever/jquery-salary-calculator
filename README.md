Monthly Employee Salary Calculator

Tier-2-W7 Weekend Porject

## Description
I spent about 12 hours working on this project. My goal was to solve for adding employees to the DOM and taking their annual salaries
and showing the monthly costs below a table.  My biggest problem to solve was for deleteing an employee from the DOM.  Mainly, having the employee
also removed from my array.  I felt like I was getting close but there was something I was missing when targeting the employee to delete in the array as well.
